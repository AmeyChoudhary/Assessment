    "1.  **Theme Categories:** Themes can be based on product types, use cases, demographics, or events. These are just **suggestions**. You have the creative freedom to **invent new categories** that better fit the keywords.\n",
    "2.  **Rationale is Key:** For each theme, provide a one-sentence explanation for your choice, referencing the data to support your logic.\n",
    "3.  **Data-Driven Prioritization:** Use the metrics to find the **best value**. The ideal \"sweet spot\" is a combination of **high search volume with manageable (low to medium) competition and bid costs**. Prioritize themes built around these high-potential keywords.\n",
    "4.  **Keyword Curation:** For each theme, you must select the **top keywords** that best represent the entire category. Your selection should not exceed **10 keywords**. Aim for a mix that includes both high-volume \"head\" terms and specific, high-intent \"long-tail\" terms to capture the theme's full scope.\n",

    "1.  **`analysis` key:** The value must be an object containing your strategic thought process with the following three keys:\n",
    "    * `high_value_keyword_identification`: A string explaining which keywords stand out and why, based on their balance of search volume, competition, and cost.\n",
    "    * `pattern_recognition_and_theme_ideation`: A string describing the patterns and connections you found and the potential themes you brainstormed.\n",
    "    * `final_strategy_and_grouping_logic`: A string defining the final, solidified logic you will use to group the keywords into themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`themed_keywords` key:** The value must be an array `[]` of theme objects. Each theme object must have the following three keys:\n",
    "    * `theme_name`: A string for the name of the theme.\n",
    "    * `rationale`: A string containing the one-sentence rationale for the theme.\n",
